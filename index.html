    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Video Game Sales Over the Years</h1>
     <p>Video games have changed from a small niche market into a multi billion dollar industry. Consoles have been made by companies like Atari, Microsoft, Nintendo, Sega and Sony. The dataset used has tracked the sales of these console games over the years, from 1980 thru part of 2017. The dataset used was obtained here: https://www.kaggle.com/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings </p>

    <p>Looking at the chart below, it can be seen that there has been a gradual increase in sales from 1980 until 2008, with over 60x the amount of sales in 2008 compared to 1980. But what happened in 2009 that started the gradual decline in sales from these  “traditional” consoles?  </p>

    <p>The answer is not that people are playing less video games than before, but the fact that they are playing them in a different way. The original iPhone was released in 2007, but it did not immediately get looked at as a way to play games. But as the developers got better at creating games, and found new ways to get profits off of them, including downloadable content and ad based revenue, more and more people began playing games on their phones and ipads. More insight into the new mobile game revolution can be seen on the next slide. </p>
