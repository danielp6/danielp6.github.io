    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Video Game Sales Over the Years</h1>
     <p align = "center" >Video games have changed from a small niche market into a multi billion dollar industry. Consoles have been made by companies like Atari, Microsoft, Nintendo, Sega and Sony. The dataset used has tracked the sales of these console games over the years, from 1980 thru part of 2017. The dataset used was obtained here: https://www.kaggle.com/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings </p>

    <p align = "center" >Looking at the chart below, it can be seen that there has been a gradual increase in sales from 1980 until 2008, with over 60x the amount of sales in 2008 compared to 1980. But what happened in 2009 that started the gradual decline in sales from these  “traditional” consoles? More insight into why this might be can be seen on the next slide. </p>
